# Spring Boot Reactive Project

This is a sample Spring Boot project that demonstrates the use of reactive programming. Reactive programming is an asynchronous programming paradigm that allows you to handle streams of data and events. In this project, we leverage the reactive capabilities provided by the Spring Framework.

## Features

- **Reactive Web Endpoints**: Utilizes the Spring WebFlux module to create reactive RESTful web endpoints.
- **Reactive Data Access**: Demonstrates reactive data access using Spring Data Reactive Repositories.
- **WebSocket Integration**: Includes WebSocket support for real-time communication.
- **Functional Reactive Endpoints**: Illustrates the use of functional programming style for defining reactive endpoints.
- **Reactive Streams**: Leverages Project Reactor's Flux and Mono to handle asynchronous streams of data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later
